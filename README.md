# FLU-SHOT-LEARNING-PREDICT-H1N1-AND-SEASONAL-FLU-VACCINES
The H1N1 Flu that came into existence in 2009 in the U.S. and spread to the rest of the world had a great impact on the lives of people around the world. It was a life-threatening season to hundreds of people mainly below 65 years old which eventually made the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it as the greatest pandemic in more than 40 years. Since it continues to circulate seasonally worldwide vaccination should be carried out effectively. The vaccines for H1N1 were first publicly available in the United States in October 2009, when the United States government began a vaccination campaign and people took vaccination based on certain factors. So, to find out the vaccination status National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS) was conducted. In this paper, we use the data from the above survey to develop a model that predicts how likely people got H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccine.
